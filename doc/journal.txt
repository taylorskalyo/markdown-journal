==============================================================================

This plugin is designed to make keeping a markdown journal easier. It provides
commands for generating indexes of dated markdown files, giving you a high
level view of the journal's contents.

This plugin also allows you to label sections of markdown. You can also think
of labels as keywords or tags. They can appear anywhere in a markdown file
(except for code blocks and code fences). The syntax looks like this: >
  # Heading

  :label:

  Content goes here.
<
In this example, the section titled "Heading" would be assigned a label,
"label". Any combination of letters, digits, underscores (`_`), and dashes
(`-`) between to colons (`:`) creates a label.
